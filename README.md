# RGH-PC-Audio
Python 3 scripts designed for extracting and reimporting custom audio for RGH.

# LyN_Extract
Usage: `python3 Lyn_Extract.py <input.sns> <output.wav>`

# LyN_Reimport
Usage: `python3 Lyn_Reimport.py <input.sns> <input.wav> <output.sns>`

# Requirements
Ensure that `ffmpeg` and `oggenc2` are available in your system's `PATH` for these scripts to function properly.

# Features
You can successfully play custom SNS files with vgmstream. However, further work is needed to enable them for in-game use.

# Contributions
Feel free to update and improve the original code, especially if you're able to make it work for in-game use or fix any issues.
